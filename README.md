An on the go platform to keep you aware what's happening in the world.
The NewsApp boasts small cards that contain eye-catching headlines, making it easy to quickly scan through the latest news and has a Read More option where  you can find the source of the news. Additionally, the app utilizes a gamified user interface created with the help of Salesforce app builder.

With these features, the newsApp provides a seamless and engaging news browsing experience.
